# Assembling a bacterial genome sequence - exploiting long reads

Previously, we assembled a bacterial genome sequence from about a million pairs of short sequence reads.
This produced a draft-quality genome sequence that was, unfortunately, fragmented into hundreds of contigs.

In the following exercise, we will experience the value of using long sequencing reads to improve the genome assembly.
